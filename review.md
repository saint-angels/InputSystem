# Review


# TODO:
- make tests
- add defaults
- can we make it behave more like a button? Overriding the
"actuation point" to trigger when it becomes a circle
- support different input methods
- write documentation that highlights all usage scenarios


# WTFs:

Guide tells you how to select things in editor
and how they work individually

But it doesn't tell you how to elements connect
Like, 
- how do you get which binding is driving the interaction?

On a page of every system, it would be great to mention things that it interacts with and how.
If examples are present, that would be even better.

It makes me feel, that the documentation expects the user to read every page thoroughly and form the required connections themselves.
